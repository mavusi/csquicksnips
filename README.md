# C# Advanced Productivity Snippets
This extension provides various snippets to quickly generate slightly more complex frequently used C# classes.

## Usage
All these snippets are prefixed with "snip" as well as "snip-?" to bundle them up neatly by category.

E.g. to insert a new Web Api Controller, start typing "snip". A list of snippets will pop up. You can either press down to select the API snippet, or continue typing "snip-api" to select the specific snippet automatically.

This will generate your entire API controller for you, ready for dependency injection.
